# Sysadmin Day WordPress Widget 

A simple WordPress Widget to let you know when Sysadmin Day is near, and here! With a link to my Amazon wishlist for IT books and gear for ideas on what a sysadmin might like as a thank you!

## Features

* Fun!  This is strictly for fun and entirely non-canonical
* Meant to help you remember your hardworking system administrators on their made up holiday
* Free!  I offer this to you for free.  Please use it as you will and enjoy!
* Also, please give credit where credit is due.  If you make something more of this, please, link back to this code, as sloppy as it is.

## Usage

1. Copy the `SysAdminDayrWidget` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the "Plugins" dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads "Sysadmin Day Widget"
4. Click on "Activate"

You may need to place that widget on your sidebar, if you don't have it set to automatically add activated widgets.
